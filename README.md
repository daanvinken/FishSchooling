# Co-evolution of fish schooling predator-prey interactions (group project)


# File overview

| File           | Description   |
|----------------|---------------|
| `fishmodel.py`        | Contains the definition of our model |
| `parameter_fit.py`    | Evolves the prey and predators for many generations to find a fit for the parameters |
| `visual_scatter.py`   | Creates an animated visualisation of the model in 3D |
|||
| `evolved_plot.py`     | Plots evolution of parameters agains deaths of prey |
| `orientation.py`      | Plots nearest neighbour orientation distribution |
| `param_sweep.py`      | Sensitivity analysis |
| `visual_quiver.py`    | Same as `visual_scatter.py` but with a quiver plot |
| `visual_static.py`    | Single timeframe visualisation of model |
| `2dvisual_scatter.py` | Animated 2D visualisation of model |


# Quickstart

To see the model in action run the following command:   

```bash 
python visual_scatter.py 
```

# Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
